# SSHBrowse

SSHBrowse is a cross-platform desktop app for managing SSH, SFTP, and local terminal sessions. It is built for people looking for a modern alternative to SecureCRT, MobaXterm, and other session managers.

Save and organize connections, open sessions in tabs or tiles, and send commands or live input to multiple terminals at once. SSHBrowse runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

SSHBrowse is currently in beta. Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are welcome.

## Your OpenSSH, not ours

The actual SSH and SFTP connections, authentication, host-key verification, and SSH configuration are handled by your system's `ssh` and `sftp` clients.

SSHBrowse does not implement the SSH protocol itself, proxy SSH traffic through another service, or store your passwords or private keys.

## Highlights

- Save and organize SSH connections in folders
- Import aliases from your OpenSSH config
- Choose a saved connection as a jump host, or enter a raw ProxyJump route
- Open SSH, SFTP, and local terminal sessions
- Search terminal output and configure scrollback history
- Work with tabs or tiled terminals
- Send commands or live input to multiple sessions

## Platforms

SSHBrowse provides native packages for macOS, Windows, and Linux. The following platforms have been tested with packaged releases:

| Platform | Package | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS 15+ (Apple silicon and Intel) | Universal DMG | Native packaged acceptance performed on Apple silicon. Ad-hoc signed, not notarized; Gatekeeper may require manual approval. |
| Linux x86-64 | Binary, DEB or RPM | Requires GTK4 and WebKitGTK 6.0. Fedora 44 GNOME/Wayland RPM and Ubuntu 26.04 GNOME/Wayland DEB accepted natively. Other distributions are less tested. Local packages are not repository-signed. |
| Windows 11 x64 only | Per-user installer | Native acceptance has covered the installer and core SSH/SFTP behavior. Requires the Windows OpenSSH Client and Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime, normally included with Windows 11; Setup stops if WebView2 is missing. SSHBrowse does not bundle, download, or install WebView2. The installer is unsigned; SmartScreen may warn. |

For release downloads, check the architecture and compare the SHA-256 hash with `SHA256SUMS`.

## Get started

Download the latest package from [Releases](https://github.com/sshbrowse/sshbrowse/releases).

Linux release notes include manual installation steps and an optional installer script.

After launching SSHBrowse, you can:

- Create a saved connection
- Import aliases with **Shell > Import from SSH Config…**
- Enter `user@host:port` directly in the new-tab picker

Use **Find in Terminal…** in the application or terminal context menu to search
the selected pane (Cmd+F on macOS, Ctrl+Shift+F on Linux and Windows). Set retained
history under **Settings > Terminal > Scrollback lines**. Search may be unavailable
for very long wrapped output; clear the terminal or reduce scrollback to resume.

## Help and contributing

Release builds check GitHub for updates at startup, at most once every 24 hours. Disable this in **Settings > General > Updates**. Downloads and restarts require your approval. Linux binaries installed at `~/.local/bin/sshbrowse` support in-app updates; DEB/RPM installations link to the release for package updates.

For connection problems, try the same destination with system OpenSSH (`ssh alias` or `ssh user@host`). Use the [bug report form](https://github.com/sshbrowse/sshbrowse/issues/new/choose) for bugs and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reports. Redact credentials and private host details.

Bug reports, suggestions, and focused pull requests are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, contribution terms, and guidance on discussing larger changes first.
